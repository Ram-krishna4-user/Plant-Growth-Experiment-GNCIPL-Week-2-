This project presents a data-driven analysis of plant growth performance under varying environmental and nutrient conditions using Microsoft Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.
The goal is to identify how key factors — such as temperature, humidity, soil type, nutrient level, and water availability — influence the average plant growth rate (cm/day).

Key Features : ---

-- Analysis of multiple environmental parameters:
1. Growth rate vs. Temperature level
2. Growth rate vs. Humidity level
3. Growth rate vs. Soil type
4. Growth rate vs. Water level
5. Growth rate vs. Nutrient level
6. Growth rate vs. Growth condition
   
-- Dynamic slicers for quick filtering by Plant Type,

-- Clean visual layout with automatic updates when data changes
